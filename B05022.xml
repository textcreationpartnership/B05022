         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>INFORMATION</hi> For the Lady <hi>Craigleith,</hi> and Laird of <hi>Preſtoungrange,</hi> at firſt preſented againſt Sir <hi>James Rochead,</hi> and now repeated againſt <hi>James Rochead</hi> his Son, with an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for the Laird of <hi>Mortounhall,</hi> humbly offered to the Members of the Committee for Security.</head>
            <p>THe deceaſt <hi>John Rochead</hi> of <hi>Craigleith,</hi> eldeſt Brother to the ſaid Sir <hi>James,</hi> in his Contract of Marriage with <hi>Kathrine Trotter</hi> his Lady, is obliged to provide his Lands to his Heirs whatſomever, and coming to dy about <hi>November</hi> 1673. years, he leaves only one Child, a Daughter of the Marrige, whom in his Teſtament he names his Executrix and univerſal Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix, and leaves to his Lady 6000. <hi>merks</hi> of Legacy: and farder appoints her ſole Tutrix to his ſaid Daughter, recomending the Care and Education of her very particularly and earneſtly.</p>
            <p>And farder, there is a Clauſe interlined in the Teſtament, whereby he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains his Daughter to match with his ſaid Brothers eldeſt Son, if it ſhall pleaſe the Lord to ſpare her, the Daughter being about that time ſcarce nine years of Age, and Sir <hi>James</hi> his eldeſt Son about three years younger.</p>
            <p>After the Fathers Deceaſe, the Lady <hi>Craigleith</hi> as ſole Tutrix takes upon her the Care and Education of her Daughter, and performs it with all Tenderneſs, and when her Daughter grows up to almoſt twelve years of Age, thinks how ſhe may be diſpoſed upon for her beſt Advantage, but Sir <hi>James</hi> laying hold upon the Recomendation in his Brothers Teſtament, touching his Daughters Marriage with his Son to make all ſure, Impetrats from the Privy Council, a Warrand for ſequeſtracting the Daughter in the Family of the Biſhop of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> without ever calling or hearing the Mother ſole Tutrix, or any other Party concerned, which Warrand being evidently very ſummar and undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly Impetrat by the great Moyan Sir <hi>James,</hi> then had with ſome principal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Council, and the effect of it being to pull an only Daughter out of her Mothers Arms, to whom her Father had ſo earneſtly recommended her, and to expoſe her to the will and pleaſure of Sir <hi>James,</hi> her next Heir appearand, the Lady did not think her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſelf obliged to comply with it, beſides the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of it was ſo amazing to her young Daughter, that ſhe cryed moſt bitterly and hung about her Mothers Neck, when the Intimation of the Order was made to her, crying out that ſhe ſhould not leave her Mother, nor ever marry Sir <hi>James</hi>'s Son, and ſo ſlipt out of her Mothers Houſe; and her Mother obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her Daughters Averſion, &amp; many other things not proper her to be comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate, and in a word being deſirout to diſpoſs upon her Daughter, as both the ill Conſequences of a conſtrained and unpromiſing Marriage might be evited, and the Fathers Recomendation far more effectually ſatisfied, makes up and concludes the Marriage betwivxt her Daughter and <hi>Preſtoun-Grange</hi> now her
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:176063:2"/>Husband, whom all muſt now grant to have been a moſt proper and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Choice.</p>
            <p>But there being a neceſſity to have the Marriage privatly celebrate, becauſe of Sir <hi>James</hi> his Power and Influence for the time, the Parties go to the <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and are there married by a Non-conform Miniſter, whereas Sir <hi>James Stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi> highly conveens, not only the Lady <hi>Craiglieth</hi> with her Daughter, and <hi>Prectoun Grange</hi> her Husband, but alſo <hi>Henry Trotter</hi> of <hi>Mortoun-hall,</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoun-Grange</hi> elder: and libelling them before the Council upon an Act of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil made in the year 1668. whereby it is declared, that ſuch as take away any young Gentle-woman within Age contrary to the Councils Commands ſhould be ſhould be punished as they ſhould think fit: and that ſuch as contract Marriage with them ſhould be punished by Fines equivalent to their Tocher. and upon the Councils foreſaid Order for Sequeſtration, and likeways making mention of the Fathers Teſtament and Recomendation, &amp; that it was by his procurement that the 6000 <hi>merks</hi> of Legacy was left to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet ſhe, and her Complices had ſent her away to the Border to be married there to <hi>Preſton-grange,</hi> by an outed Miniſter, to the high Contempt as he alledged of Authority, he obtained the Lady to be Fyned in no leſs than 6500 <hi>merks,</hi> and the reſt in 3500 <hi>merks,</hi> and 9000 <hi>merks</hi> to be given to himſelf, for his pretended Damages, beſide the Legal Fine of 1000 <hi>merks</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon <hi>Preſton-grange,</hi> for his clandeſtine Marriage, and accordingly all theſe Fines were payed.</p>
            <p>But it being declared by the Claim of Right, that extraordinary Fines are contrary to Law, the Lady <hi>Craigleith</hi> hath now appealed to the Parliament, and obtained a Reference to the Commiſſion for Fines and Forefaultures, to have the ſame there tryed and examined, in order to her Redreſs, and that ſhe and <hi>Prestoungrange</hi> have good reaſon to demand this Redreſs, appears.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe the foreſaid Act of Council 1668, was made upon the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a particular caſe of a young Gentlewomans being carried away without the conſent or knowledge of her Friends, and cannot in reaſon be farder exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſince no man of Senſe will think that it was the meaning of the Council, to make themſelves abſolute Arbiters of all young Gentlewomens Marriages, as the words lybelled upon ſeem to import; But ſo it is, that <hi>Prestoungrange</hi> did carry away his Lady, with her own, her Mother, and all Friends Conſent, Sir <hi>James</hi> only excepted, ſo that this Act of Council concerns not this caſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is evident, that even the Council did not judge that <hi>Paeſtoungranges</hi> caſe did belong to the foreſaid Act, otherways they ſhould (and undoubtedly would) have fined him in the Equivalent of his Tocher, whieh we ſee they have not done. But 3. Whatever is in this Order of Council more than Law allows, could not at that time, nor is at any time binding; but ſo it is, that all that can be found in <hi>Preſtoungranges</hi> caſe, was a clandiſtine Marriage, whereof the pain of Law is only 1000 Merks.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As to the Councils Order for Sequeſtration, It is not doubted, but that the Council may in certain Caſes Sequeſtrate; But then it ought to be upon the hearing of Parties, and certainly, if Parties had been firſt heard, the Council had not granted this Order: And if the Lady was both ſurprized and terrified to find her Daughter taken from her, and ordered to a Biſhops houſe, at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Sir <hi>James</hi> her nixt Heir, and ſo far contrary to her Daughters Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and both their Inclinations, it was nothing to be wondred at, but a matter every way excuſable, and could not juſtly be conſtrued a Contempt of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:176063:2"/>Authority, where Sir <hi>James</hi> had proceeded ſo illegally, and had only Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the Order upon his own Peril.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As to what Sir <hi>James</hi> pretended from his Brothers Teſtament;
<list>
                  <item>1. It is poſſitively affirmed, that the Recommendation in the Teſtament was inſert and interlined, after it was Subſcribed. But</item>
                  <item>2. Whether it was ſo or not, the Words bear only a Recomendation or Advice, which imports no Obligation, and always leavs a latitude for a more equal Choice.</item>
                  <item>3. It was a moſt falſe Inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, That Sir <hi>James</hi> procured the Legacy of 6000 <hi>merks</hi> to be left to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, nor is there the leſt veſtige in the Teſtament, that that Legacy had the leaſt reſpect to the foreſaid Recommendation.</item>
                  <item>4. No rational man can doubt, but if the deceaſt <hi>John Rochead</hi> were alive this day, He would approve his Ladies Choice, and paſs from his own Recommendation. And it was notourly known that the Sequeſtration was contrived by Sir <hi>James,</hi> not in order to a Marriage with his own Son, but he was to diſpoſe of her to another Perſon on purpoſe to make his Intereſt at Court.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. As to the Ladies marying her Daughter to <hi>Preſton-grange,</hi> it was evident at that time by all that were Impartial, judged to be the more equal Marriage: Sir <hi>James</hi> his Son was three years younger than the Ladies Daughter, and the Daughters Marriage did not happen till near three years after the Fathers Death, in which ſpace, many Grounds of Averſion and Alienation might have fallen in, as in effect they did, which might juſtly determine both the Mother and the Daughter to make a new Choice, notwithſtanding of the Defuncts Recomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. If the Daughter and Sir <hi>James</hi>'s Son had been both Marriageable when the Father died, the Recomendation might have had more weight, but to think that a Recomendation of Marriage, as to Perſons under Age, ſhould be of any moment three years thereafter, againſt a more equal Choice made be both Mother and Daughter, is contrary both to the Liberty of Marriage, and all Rules of Good Senſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That <hi>Preſtoun-Grange</hi> was married by an Outed-Miniſter, is clearly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and <hi>in terminis</hi> Lybelled; And the very Act of Parliament diſcharging Marriages by Outted Miniſters, is one of the Acts lybelled upon: but whether this ſhould have been an Aggravation for ſo exorbitant a Fyne, all men may judge.</p>
            <p>In Reſpect whereof, it is evident, that the Grounds of the ſaid Fyne were Arbitrary, and the Fyne it ſelf extraordinary and exorbitant, and ſuch as are Condemned by the Claim of Right, and is moſt juſtly referred to the Cognition of this Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>James</hi> would willingly decline the Commiſſion, or have the Commiſſion to decline themſelves; becauſe this Caſe ſeems not to be included in the Act of Parliament, which grants this Commiſſion.
<list>
                  <item>But Firſt, if it had been more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly included in that Act, it had not needed an expreſs Reference.</item>
                  <item>2. Its Reference is the ſame, and every way as Valid as many others made by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to this Commiſſion, without any formal Vote, and far more Remote from the Subject of the ſaid Act of Parliament. But</item>
                  <item>3. This Caſe is clearly comprehended in the Claim of Right; which its well known, was the Rule principally regarded in making the foreſaid Act of Parliament; and had the caſe been then named, it had certainly been expreſly Included.</item>
                  <item>4. In ſo far as mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying by an Outted-Miniſter, is made one of the principal Aggravations of this Sentence: it falls directly within the Compaſs of the ſaid Act of Parliament; and its very like, that at that time the Ladies refuſing to put her Daughter in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:176063:3"/>the Biſhops houſe, and her Daughters marrying by an Outted Miniſter, were the greateſt Ingredients in their Guilt, to procure this heavy Fyne.</item>
                  <item>5. It is evident, that this Matter cannot be Tryed by any other Court, but by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; for ſeing the Fyne was Impoſed by Act of Council, and was manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exorbitant, and by the Claim of Right, appointed to be Conſidered and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed. It is obvious, that the Parliament are the only proper Judges in this Review. And</item>
                  <item>6. Since that this Commiſſion is only to Try and Report; <hi>Inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leith</hi> muſt have a very ſuſpicious Diffidence of his Cauſe, if he draw back from the Commiſſion, and be unwilling that His Majeſtie and the Parliament De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine in it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>This Affair being afterwards brought before the ſaid Commiſſion, and Deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their Preſence; the Commiſſion induced, the Parties to ſubmit, and gave forth their Decreet Arbitral: But Sir <hi>James</hi> having Reclaimed againſt it, the Lady <hi>Craigleith</hi> did likewiſe Reſile, and ſo the Decreet took no Effect. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, <hi>John Trotter</hi> now of <hi>Mortounhall,</hi> as repreſenting his Father, who was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe concerned in that Matter, did not at all ſubmit: and therefore, both he, and the Lady <hi>Craigleith,</hi> and <hi>Preſtoun-Grange</hi> for his Intereſt, do humbly apply to the Committee for Security; as come in place of the foreſaid Commiſſion, to have this whole Matter Reported and Determined in Parliament.</p>
